A distributed, fault-tolerant **key-value store** implemented in **Golang**, built on the Raft consensus algorithm. This system ensures consistency across nodes, handles leader elections, and persists logs to disk.

---

## Features

- **Raft Consensus**: Leader election and log replication
- **Strong Consistency**: Ensures a single source of truth across nodes
- **Persistence**: State survives node crashes via disk storage
- **Cluster Communication**: Nodes communicate over HTTP/RPC
- **Fault Tolerance**: Survives leader failure, recovers automatically

---

## Tech Stack

- **Golang 1.20+**
- **Custom Raft implementation** (no external Raft libraries)
- **Persistent log files** for durability
- **gRPC / HTTP** (for inter-node communication, if used)
